zenbot strategies

These are my custom Zenbot  strategies. A couple are actively in live trading mode right now!

My focus has been to make as few errors as possible even with market motion. My lowest so far in a simulation has been 2.8% over 30 days.

You can find Zenbot over at https://github.com/DeviaVir/zenbot

If you find use of these, let me know or drop some coin my way.
